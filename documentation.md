In this challenge Simple Array Sum 
I used 3 methods in JavaScript :
- forEach 
- forLoop
- reduce

Between all of them, the most efficient is reduce, this reduce method
has 2 important elements: accumulator and currentValue.

I included also a method named sum which is a pre-built in Python
so It is not necessary to define the sum method because it is pre-built.
